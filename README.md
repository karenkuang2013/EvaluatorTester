# EvaluatorTester
In this project, I was required to create a common caluator using Stack.
Two stacks need to be created in this project. One is the operator stack and the other is the oeprand stack.
This calculator is able to handle left-associated operation( "+","-","*","/","()") and one kind of right-associated operation("^").
I also created the GUI for this calculator.
